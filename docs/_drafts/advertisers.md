*Abandoning this draft because it takes the wrong angle. Most people know this topic.*

Isn't it cool that everything on the internet is free? Or so it seems. As the saying
goes, nothing in this world is free. So how do these companies make money?

As of time of writing, Facebook is worth over 750 **billion** dollars. Google is worth
more than 1 **trillion** dollars. Clearly they're very good at making money.
Many of today's most valuable companies are tech companies, and for some of 
them, their main product is free.

When you buy ice cream, you fork over cold hard cash in exchange for sugary bliss. The
shop has to pay for expenses like ingredients, electricity and rent. The remainder
goes into the owner's pocket as profit. Most people get it, there's not much to 
understand. 

Facebook & Google are different. They show you advertisements that are very relevant.
They're much more relevant than the advertisements in magazines, billboards and TV 
because they're personalized and tailored to fit your interests. More relevant ads
means that you're more likely to engage, so companies will pay more for these ads.
