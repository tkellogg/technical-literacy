title:  "You'll be angry when you find out what fake news is doing to us"

That title is clickbait â€” it gives you zero information. Instead, it tells you what you're 
going to feel. Yet somehow we click anyway. Let's talk about clickbait.

On the scale from zero to fake news, clickbait is a seemingly innocent middle ground. 

Here are some other clickbait headlines:

> An old Bible held a shocking surprise that turned out to be an enriching experience

Without reading, all we know is it's something about the Bible. The main message is 
"this will take you on an emotional roller coaster".

> Trump is destroying his own party on the way out the door




This is the remaining part of the post.
